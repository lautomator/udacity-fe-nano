### Game Instructions
The object of the game is to get to the other side of the road without getting hit by the oncoming traffic. If you do get hit, you go back to the original side of the road where you started. Every successfull pass receives a point. Every 10 points will get you a gem. Gems are added below your score. The game play continues until 100, at which point the score will turn over to zero.
