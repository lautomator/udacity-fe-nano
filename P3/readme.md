### Game Instructions
The object of the game is to get to the other side of the road without getting hit by the oncoming traffic. If you do get hit, you lose a point and go back to the original side of the road where you started. Every successfull pass receives a point. Every 10 points will get you a gem. Gems are added below your score. Once you earn a gem, it cannot be taken away, even if your score decreases. If your score goes below zero, you lose and the game play ends.
