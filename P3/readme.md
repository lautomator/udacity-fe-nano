### Game Instructions
Right now, Lenny, the frog, is blue, fearing the prospect of leaping across this busy freeway. Get Lenny through the traffic to the other side unscathed so that he can turn back to his original color (green, of course!). It takes at least 10 passes to see a change in Lenny's color. If Lenny is hit, he goes back to the original side of the road where he started.

###Controls
* Use the arrow keys [&uarr; &darr; &larr; &rarr;] to move around the board.
* The `how to play` button will toggle the instructions.
* The `new game` button will reset the score to 0 and revert the player's position.

**Scoring**
Every successfull pass receives a point. Keep playing until Lenny turns green!
